# Local setup

## Dependencies
Dependencies are handled through Docker. Please make sure you have the latest version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

_NOTE_: There might be some nuances to the setup process depending on your OS. These instructions are based on MacOS and should work for Linux distros as well. Please check later section for other environments.

List of dependencies:
* jsonserver
* RabbitMQ

Once you have docker & docker-compose installed, you can start dependent services by executing the following command:
```
~/Projects/tc-connect-notifications/local
> docker-compose up
```



## Other Environments
Please raise github issues or forums to report other environment issues. We need help keeping this section up to date. Thanks!
